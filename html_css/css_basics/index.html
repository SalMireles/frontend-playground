      In practice, both interfaces and types can often be used interchangeably
      for many scenarios, and the choice between them may come down to personal
      preference or existing conventions in your project or team. TypeScript has
      evolved over time, and both interfaces and types have gained more features
      and capabilities, so the lines between them have become less distinct. In
      modern TypeScript, you can often choose the one that fits your coding
      style and project requirements best, and TypeScript will provide similar
      type checking and IntelliSense support for both.
